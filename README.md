# string-calculator-tdd

This project implements a String Calculator using **Test-Driven Development** in JavaScript.  
Itâ€™s designed to show clean, incremental development with meaningful commits and working tests at every step.

## Problem Statement:

Write a method `add(string numbers)` that returns the sum of numbers in the string.  
It should support:

- Empty string returns 0  
- Single or multiple comma-separated numbers  
- Newline `\n` as valid delimiter  
- Custom delimiter in format `//;\n1;2`  
- Negative numbers throw an error  
- Numbers >1000 are ignored (additional)

## TDD Breakdown:

Each feature was implemented **one test at a time**, committing after:

- Failing test
- Minimal code to pass
- Refactor

## Final GUI Demo:

## How to Run Locally:
npm install
npm test


Or open `index.html` and test it in the browser.
